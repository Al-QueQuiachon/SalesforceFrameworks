## Technical Details

### Component Structure

- **LWC Component**: `dynamicRecordListView`
- **Apex Controller**: `DynamicRecordListViewController.cls`

### Performance Considerations

- The component uses client-side filtering for performance when possible
- Server-side SOQL queries are optimized for specific use cases
- Pagination helps manage large data sets efficiently

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Records Displayed**
   - Verify object API name is correct
   - Check that fields in the list view fields exist
   - Ensure current user has access to the object and fields

2. **Related Records Not Showing**
   - Verify user has access to related objects
   - Check that relationship fields are correctly defined
   - Ensure max navigation depth is set appropriately

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Consider reducing the number of displayed fields
   - Increase records per page for fewer server calls
   - Use more specific filters to reduce data volume
