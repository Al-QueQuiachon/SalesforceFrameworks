## How to Configure and Use

### Installation

1. Deploy the component using Salesforce CLI or directly within your Salesforce org.
2. Configure connected app settings for your LLM providers.
3. Ensure all dependencies (apex classes, LWC, custom settings) are deployed together.

### Configuration

1. Navigate to the page where you want to add the NuviAI Assistant.
2. Edit the page and drag the "LLM Assistant" component from the custom components section.
3. Configure the following properties:
   - **Primary Color**: Main theme color (default: #22BDC1).
   - **Accent Color**: Secondary theme color (default: #D5DF23).
   - **Card Title**: Title displayed in the component header (default: "AI Assistant").
   - **Default Model Name**: Preferred LLM to use by default.
   - **Hide Model Selector**: Option to simplify UI by hiding model selection.
   - **Context Prompt**: Custom context to provide to the LLM about its purpose.
   - **Enable Anomaly Detection**: Turn on automatic checking for unusual patterns.
   - **Enable Image Analysis**: Enable the ability to analyze images attached to records.
   - **Related Objects**: Comma-separated list of related objects to include in context.
   - **Analysis Field API Name**: Field where analysis summaries can be saved.

### Usage

1. **Ask Questions**: Type natural language queries about the current record or general topics.
2. **Analyze Record**: Click the analyze button to get AI insights about the current record.
3. **Analyze Images**: Process attached images and PDFs to extract text and visual information.
4. **Generate Content**: Request drafts of emails, summaries, or other content.
5. **Save Analysis**: Save important insights directly to the record for future reference.
6. **View History**: Access previous conversations for context or reference.

### Image Analysis Feature

The Image Analysis capability allows you to:
- Extract text from images and documents using OpenAI's Vision API
- Understand diagrams, charts, and visual content
- Process PDFs to extract meaningful information
- Analyze business cards, receipts, and other visual materials
- Convert image content into structured information

To use this feature:
1. Ensure the "Enable Image Analysis" option is turned on (this shows the "Analyze Images" button)
2. Upload images or documents (JPG, PNG, GIF, PDF) to the Salesforce record as Files
3. Click the "Analyze Images" button in the LLM Assistant
4. Optionally enter a prompt to guide the analysis (e.g., "Extract contact information from this business card")
5. The AI will process the images and provide detailed information about their contents

**Automatic Document Analysis:**
- When using "Analyze Record", PDFs and images are automatically detected and processed using OpenAI's Vision API
- This happens even if you select a different model from the dropdown - documents always use Vision capabilities
- The analysis will include a dedicated "Document Analysis" section containing the Vision API's interpretation
- This integration provides seamless document understanding without requiring a separate analysis step

**Important Notes:**
- Image analysis always uses OpenAI's GPT4o Vision model, regardless of which model is selected in the dropdown
- The model name in the response will correctly display as "OpenAI GPT4o Vision" when using the dedicated "Analyze Images" button
- PDF files are fully supported and will be processed like images
- Files must be under 5MB to be processed
- Multiple images/documents can be analyzed in a single request

**Analyzing Content with GPT4o Vision:**

This component provides two different ways to analyze document content:

1. **Analyze Images Button:** 
   - Processes ONLY image files (JPG, PNG, GIF)
   - Ignores PDFs and other document types
   - Best for specifically analyzing visual content
   - Uses OpenAI's GPT4o Vision model

2. **Analyze Record Button:**
   - Processes ALL attachment types (images, PDFs, documents)
   - Uses Vision capabilities for all attachments (not just images)
   - Provides comprehensive document analysis alongside record details
   - Combines standard LLM analysis with Vision-powered document insights
   - Always uses GPT4o for document analysis regardless of selected model

This dual approach gives you flexibility - use "Analyze Images" when you only want to focus on visual content, and use "Analyze Record" when you want a complete analysis of all record data including all attached documents.

## Technical Details

### Component Structure

- **LWC Component**: `llmAssistant`
- **Apex Controller**: `LLMController.cls`
- **Custom Settings**: Configuration for LLM providers and defaults

### Image Processing Implementation

The image processing functionality works by:
1. Retrieving image attachments from the current record using Salesforce's ContentDocument API
2. Converting each image to base64 format
3. Sending the images to OpenAI's Vision-capable models (GPT-4 Vision)
4. Processing the response and displaying the results to the user

This implementation has several advantages:
- No need to store images in external systems
- Secure processing within the Salesforce ecosystem
- Support for multiple file types including JPEG, PNG, and PDF
- Ability to process multiple images in a single request
- Integration with the existing conversation history system

### Security Considerations

- API keys for LLM providers are stored securely using Named Credentials
- Data sent to external AI services follows Salesforce security best practices
- The component respects Salesforce field-level security and sharing rules
- Images are processed securely with appropriate size limits and controls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Not Available**
   - Verify API credentials are properly configured
   - Check usage limits with the AI provider
   - Ensure network connectivity to the AI service

2. **Incomplete Analysis**
   - Consider providing more context in prompts
   - Check if the AI model has access to necessary data
   - Try a different model if available

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Large amounts of data may slow response times
   - Consider limiting the scope of related data included
   - Use more specific prompts for complex questions

4. **Image Processing Issues**
   - Ensure images are under the 5MB size limit
   - Check that the file format is supported (JPEG, PNG, GIF, PDF)
   - Verify the OpenAI GPT4 Vision configuration is properly set up
   - For better results with text extraction, provide clear images with good contrast
